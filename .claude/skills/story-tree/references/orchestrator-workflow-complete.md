# Complete Orchestrator Workflow (Target State)

This diagram shows the **complete target state** for a fully integrated orchestrator that handles all stage transitions in a unified drain-pipeline pattern.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Drain-Forward Pattern**: Process later stages FIRST to make room, then earlier stages.

The orchestrator should:
1. **Drain the pipeline** - Move stories forward through stages
2. **Fill from the top** - Only add new work when capacity exists
3. **Gate appropriately** - Use holds to pause stories needing attention

**Vetting as a Funnel**: Reduce human workload, don't add to it.

Vetting filters OUT conflicting concepts automatically:
1. **Deterministic script** - Removes obvious duplicates/overlaps
2. **LLM analysis** - Removes semantic conflicts
3. **Human review** - Approves only clean, non-conflicting concepts

Conflicting concepts are auto-disposed (`disposition='conflict'`), NOT held for human review. The human's job is to evaluate good ideas, not arbitrate conflicts. Using `conflict` instead of `rejected` preserves goal/non-goal signal clarity.

**Legend**: 🤖 CI-automatable transitions (default styling) | 👤 Human-required transitions (red styling)

**Key Design Decision**: There is NO direct path from `planned (blocked)` to `active`. All planned stories must pass through `planned (no hold)` for a fresh dependency check before activation. This ensures that even if recorded blockers are resolved, any NEW dependencies that emerged are detected.

> **Note**: `review-stories.yml` is **standalone-only** and NOT part of the orchestrator loop. Human code review cannot be automated; this workflow provides tooling to assist the review process but requires human judgment to complete the transition.

## Dependency Management in activate-stories

The `activate-stories` workflow is responsible for ALL dependency-related transitions for planned stories. This consolidates dependency logic in one place.

### hold_reason Format for Blocked Stories

When a story is blocked, the specific blocker node IDs are recorded:

```
blocked:1.2.1.2,1.3.4,2.1
```

This format:
- Starts with `blocked:` prefix
- Lists comma-separated story node path IDs
- Makes blocking relationships explicit and traceable
- Enables efficient unblocking checks without re-querying the full dependency tree

### Processing Order Rationale

1. **Blocked stories first**: Check if recorded blockers are resolved, promoting them to `planned (no hold)`
2. **Unblocked stories second**: Includes both originally unblocked AND freshly unblocked stories from step 1

This ensures freshly unblocked stories get a full dependency re-check in the same cycle, catching any NEW dependencies that may have emerged since they were originally blocked.

---

## Circular Dependency Detection & Resolution

Cross-branch dependencies are allowed, which means circular dependencies are possible. The system detects and resolves them using a "newest analysis wins" strategy.

### Why Newest Wins

Code changes constantly. A dependency analysis from 2 weeks ago may no longer reflect reality. When a cycle is detected, the most recent analysis is considered more trustworthy because it was performed against the current codebase.

### Cycle Detection Algorithm

```
When activate-stories is about to mark story X as blocked by [B1, B2, ...]:

For each blocker B in [B1, B2, ...]:
    Walk B's block chain: B → B's blockers → their blockers → ...
    If X appears anywhere in that chain:
        ⚠️ CYCLE DETECTED

        Resolution:
        1. Find all stories in the chain from B back to X
        2. Clear their hold_reason (set to NULL)
        3. Add note: "CYCLE RESOLVED: stale block cleared"
        4. These stories return to planned (no hold) for re-evaluation

Then: Apply new block - X.hold_reason = 'blocked:B1,B2,...'
```

### Cycle Resolution Example

**Before** (stale state):
```
1.1 → blocked:1.2     (old analysis)
1.2 → blocked:1.3     (old analysis)
1.3 → (no hold)
```

**Today**: activate-stories analyzes 1.3, finds it depends on 1.1

**Cycle detected**: 1.3 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3

**Resolution**:
1. Trace back from 1.1: finds chain 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 (back to current story)
2. Clear stale blocks: 1.1 and 1.2 → `planned (no hold)`
3. Apply new block: 1.3 → `blocked:1.1`

**After**:
```
1.1 → (no hold)        ← cleared, will be re-evaluated
1.2 → (no hold)        ← cleared, will be re-evaluated
1.3 → blocked:1.1      ← new, current analysis
```

### SQL for Cycle Detection

```sql
-- Walk the block chain from a given story
-- Returns all stories that would be in the dependency chain
WITH RECURSIVE block_chain AS (
    -- Start with the potential blocker
    SELECT
        id,
        node_path,
        hold_reason,
        1 as depth
    FROM story_nodes
    WHERE node_path = :blocker_path
      AND hold_reason LIKE 'blocked:%'

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow each blocker in the chain
    SELECT
        s.id,
        s.node_path,
        s.hold_reason,
        bc.depth + 1
    FROM story_nodes s
    JOIN block_chain bc ON
        -- Parse blocker IDs from hold_reason and join
        s.node_path IN (
            SELECT value FROM json_each(
                '["' || REPLACE(
                    SUBSTR(bc.hold_reason, 9), -- Remove 'blocked:' prefix
                    ',', '","'
                ) || '"]'
            )

## SQL Queries for activate-stories

### Step 1: Find Blocked Stories to Check

```sql
SELECT id, node_path, title, hold_reason
FROM story_nodes
WHERE stage = 'planned'
  AND hold_reason LIKE 'blocked:%'
  AND disposition IS NULL;
```

### Step 1: Check if Recorded Blockers are Resolved

```sql
-- For a story with hold_reason = 'blocked:1.2.1,1.3.4'
-- Check if ALL listed blockers are resolved (implemented, released, or disposed)
SELECT COUNT(*) as unresolved_count
FROM story_nodes
WHERE node_path IN ('1.2.1', '1.3.4')
  AND disposition IS NULL  -- Not disposed
  AND stage NOT IN ('implemented', 'ready', 'released');

-- If unresolved_count = 0, all blockers are resolved
```

### Step 1: Clear Hold When Blockers Resolved

```sql
UPDATE story_nodes
SET
    hold_reason = NULL,
    notes = COALESCE(notes || char(10), '') ||
            'UNBLOCKED: Recorded blockers [1.2.1, 1.3.4] resolved. ' ||
            datetime('now'),
    updated_at = datetime('now')
WHERE id = :story_id;
```

### Step 2: Find Unblocked Planned Stories

```sql
SELECT id, node_path, title
FROM story_nodes
WHERE stage = 'planned'
  AND hold_reason IS NULL
  AND disposition IS NULL;
```

### Step 2: Full Dependency Check

Dependencies can include:
1. **Children** (hierarchical): Parent must wait for children
2. **Cross-branch**: Explicit dependencies on other nodes

```sql
-- Check for unmet child dependencies (depth=1 children not yet implemented)
SELECT s.node_path, s.title, s.stage
FROM story_nodes s
JOIN story_paths p ON s.id = p.descendant_id
WHERE p.ancestor_id = :story_id
  AND p.depth = 1
  AND s.disposition IS NULL
  AND s.stage NOT IN ('implemented', 'ready', 'released');
```

### Step 2: Apply New Block with Blocker IDs

```sql
UPDATE story_nodes
SET
    hold_reason = 'blocked:' || :blocker_ids,  -- e.g., 'blocked:1.2.1,1.3.4'
    notes = COALESCE(notes || char(10), '') ||
            'BLOCKED: Waiting on [' || :blocker_ids || ']. ' ||
            datetime('now'),
    updated_at = datetime('now')
WHERE id = :story_id;
```

### Step 2: Activate Story (Dependencies Met)

```sql
UPDATE story_nodes
SET
    stage = 'active',
    hold_reason = NULL,
    notes = COALESCE(notes || char(10), '') ||
            'ACTIVATED: All dependencies met. ' ||
            datetime('now'),
    updated_at = datetime('now')
WHERE id = :story_id;
```

## Exit Conditions

| Condition | Name | Meaning |
|-----------|------|---------|
| All stages empty | `IDLE` | Pipeline fully drained, no new work possible |
| Max cycles reached | `MAX_CYCLES` | Safety limit - may still have work |
| Critical error | `ABORT` | Unrecoverable failure |
| All stories held | `BLOCKED` | Every story has a hold_reason |

## Implementation Priority

Recommended order for implementing missing components:

1. **activate-stories update** - Add UNBLOCK step + cycle detection (critical path)
2. **approve-stories** - Low complexity, high value (closes loop)
3. **review-stories** - Medium complexity, enables reviewing→verifying
4. **verify-stories** - Medium complexity, uses existing skill
5. **ready-check** - Low complexity, integration verification
6. **Orchestrator expansion** - High complexity, integrates everything

*Updated: 2025-12-18 - Revised dependency management: activate-stories now handles both blocking and unblocking, with explicit blocker IDs and circular dependency detection*
