# What This Product is NOT

## Explicit Exclusions

- **Analytics & Reporting Dashboards**
  - *Reason: Analytics dashboards are what most app builders assume lawyers want, but sophisticated tables and reporting rarely provide valuable insights for time-tracking. The vision is to use AI to save lawyers time, not rebuild what already exists elsewhere.*

- **Standalone Screenshot Gallery/Viewer**
  - *Reason: Users can already open the screenshots folder via command. A dedicated browsing UI is unnecessary overhead.*
  - *Note: Could be reconsidered IF reframed as an AI-assisted clarification tool (e.g., when AI cannot categorize time, show screenshots to prompt user: "What file were you working on here?"). The gallery would serve AI workflows, not standalone browsing.*

- **Quick Actions Popup with Hotkeys**
  - *Reason: This app is meant to run in the background and be un-intrusive. Global hotkeys could interfere with the user's actual workflow tools.*

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Rebuilding Existing Tools**: Don't create features that lawyers already have elsewhere (reporting, visualization, complex analytics)
- **Intrusive UI Elements**: No popup overlays, global hotkeys, or interruptions during work
- **Feature Bloat Based on Assumptions**: Don't build what "most app builders assume lawyers want" — focus on actual user needs
- **Complex Configuration**: Avoid premature optimization settings that add complexity without clear value

## YAGNI Items

- **Screenshot Quality Optimization**
  - Configurable JPEG quality levels, WebP formats, resolution scaling, per-monitor settings
  - *Why: Unnecessary complexity before we know storage is actually a problem*

- **Quick Actions System**
  - Keyboard-activated popups for common tasks
  - *Why: Background apps should stay in the background*

## Philosophical Boundaries

**What This Product IS:**
- An un-intrusive background time tracker
- An AI-powered billing assistant that saves lawyer time
- Focused on capture and intelligent categorization

**What This Product is NOT:**
- A productivity analytics platform
- A screenshot management system
- An interactive overlay or hotkey-driven tool
- A replacement for existing legal practice management software

**Core Principle**: Use AI to eliminate manual work, not to add more features that require manual interaction. Stay invisible, capture accurately, categorize intelligently.
