## Cycle 5 Vetting Summary

**Stories scanned**: 81
**Candidates detected**: 302 (filtered to 32 after cache)
**Cache performance**: 270 false positives skipped (~95% efficiency)

**Actions taken**:
- ✓ Merged 1 pair: 1.7.6 → 1.5.5 (now "Configurable Privacy and Application Blocking")
- ✓ Deferred 1 story to pending: 1.3.6 (scope overlap with 1.8.5)
- ✓ Cached 30 false positive pairs

**Human review required**: Story 1.3.6 set to 'pending' due to scope overlap with 1.8.5 (both handle AI categorization via different approaches).
